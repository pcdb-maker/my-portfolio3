# Chloe Osborne Designs Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for **Chloe Osborne Designs**, my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a Web Developer and Digital Artist. I designed this site to highlight my skills in web development with a focus on responsive design, smooth animations, and user-friendly navigation.

## Features

### 1. Responsive Navbar and Sidebar
- I’ve built a fully responsive navbar and sidebar to ensure smooth navigation across all devices. The sidebar is optimized for mobile and tablet users, and it transitions into view with links to different sections of the portfolio.
- The **Home** link works seamlessly on all pages, ensuring smooth scrolling back to the top of the homepage.

### 2. Advanced Animations and Interactivity
- This site incorporates smooth scroll functionality, hover effects, and animations to make the user experience more engaging. I used CSS transitions and JavaScript to create subtle, responsive animations for better performance.

### 3. Built with Vite and TypeScript
- I’ve used **Vite** for lightning-fast builds and a smooth development environment. Vite allows me to develop and deploy this project with minimal build times.
- **TypeScript** is integrated throughout the project for improved code quality and type safety, helping me manage the complex React components and props efficiently.

### 4. ESLint for Code Quality
- I’ve set up **ESLint** to maintain a consistent code style and enforce best practices. Linting rules ensure that my TypeScript and JavaScript files follow high-quality standards, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

### 5. Modular CSS with Styled-Components
- For this project, I used **styled-components** to manage CSS at the component level. This makes the styles modular, reusable, and easy to handle for complex components. Styled-components also allow me to create dynamic, responsive layouts with ease.

### 6. Email Contact Button
- I’ve added a custom-styled "Contact Me" button that opens directly into the user’s email client, making it easy for anyone to reach out to me for collaborations or projects.

### 7. Smooth Scroll and Scroll-To-Top Logic
- Both the navbar and sidebar support smooth scrolling to different sections. The **Home** link scrolls back to the top with smooth animation, enhancing the user’s navigation experience.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and improve the developer experience.
- **Vite** for faster builds and optimized performance.
- **Styled-components** for managing CSS in a modular way.
- **ESLint** for maintaining code quality and enforcing best practices.
- **React-Router** for client-side routing and navigation.

## Future Enhancements
- I’m planning to further optimize the animations and transitions for better performance.
- Adding support for multiple languages is on my roadmap.
- I’d like to implement a dark mode feature soon!
